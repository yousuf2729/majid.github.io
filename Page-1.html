                <br>The UAE's rich history rooted to Islam, which came to the region in AD 630. A common religion, Islam provided the cement that held the society together. The United Arab Emirates is home to a rich cultural heritage that has been strongly influenced by its unique environment. The pearling industry thrived in 19th and early 20th centuries, providing income and employment to the people of the Gulf. Many inhabitants were semi-nomadic, pearling in the summer and tending date gardens in the winter. <br>

Young girls would dance by swinging their long black hair and swaying their bodies in time to the strong beat of the music. Men would re-enact battles fought or successful hunting expeditions, often symbolically using sticks, swords, or rifles.</p>
